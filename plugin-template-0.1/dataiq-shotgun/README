## Autotagging

This plugin requires an autotagging configuration to tag shots
To add an autotag in DataIQ, go to Settings -> Data management configuration -> Configure autotagging
The shot tag must respect this format: shot/project_sequence_shot
The following example shows a valid autotagging rule

match /shotgun_volume/([^/]+)/sequences/([^/]+)/shots/([^/]+)
   max_depth 6
   apply_tag shot/$1_$2_$3

## Configuration

The shotgun credentials need to be configured in the ca.control file or in the DataIQ UI
